To create more than 50 annotations, you have to make multiple requests to the [Update a check run](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.22/rest/reference/checks#update-a-check-run) endpoint. Each time you update the check run, annotations are appended to the list of annotations that already exist for the check run.
