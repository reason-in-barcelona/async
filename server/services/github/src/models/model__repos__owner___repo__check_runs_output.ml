The Checks API limits the number of annotations to a maximum of 50 per API request. To create more than 50 annotations, you have to make multiple requests to the [Update a check run](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.22/rest/reference/checks#update-a-check-run) endpoint. Each time you update the check run, annotations are appended to the list of annotations that already exist for the check run. For details about how you can view annotations on GitHub, see \''[About status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks#checks)\''.
