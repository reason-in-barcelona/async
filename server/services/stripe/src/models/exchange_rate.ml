 * Schema Exchange_rate.t : `Exchange Rate` objects allow you to determine the rates that Stripe is currently using to convert from one currency to another. Since this number is variable throughout the day, there are various reasons why you might want to know the current rate (for example, to dynamically price an item for a user with a default payment in a foreign currency).  If you want a guarantee that the charge is made with a certain exchange rate you expect is current, you can pass in `exchange_rate` to charges endpoints. If the value is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please refer to our [Exchange Rates API](https://stripe.com/docs/exchange-rates) guide for more details.
