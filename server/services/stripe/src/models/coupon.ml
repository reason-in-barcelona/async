 * Schema Coupon.t : A coupon contains information about a percent-off or amount-off discount you might want to apply to a customer. Coupons may be applied to [invoices](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoices) or [orders](https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_order-coupon). Coupons do not work with conventional one-off [charges](https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_charge).
