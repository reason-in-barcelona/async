 * Schema Payout.t : A `Payout` object is created when you receive funds from Stripe, or when you initiate a payout to either a bank account or debit card of a [connected Stripe account](/docs/connect/bank-debit-card-payouts). You can retrieve individual payouts, as well as list all payouts. Payouts are made on [varying schedules](/docs/connect/manage-payout-schedule), depending on your country and industry.  Related guide: [Receiving Payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts).
